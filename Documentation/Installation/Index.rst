============
Installation
============

There are two methods to set up this extension:

Utilizing the extension manager in your chosen platform, you can install the extension.
Alternatively, you can use a package manager like composer to install the extension.
For example, to install the **de-swebhosting-typo3-extension/html5mediakit** extension using composer, run the following command:

``composer require de-swebhosting-typo3-extension/html5mediakit``

After installation, ensure that you add the TypoScript template to the list of static templates.

That's it! No further configuration is required :)
