As an editor, you have the option to select the desired media file type for uploading. There are two available options: audio and video. Once you have chosen the appropriate file type, you can proceed to upload the media file in various formats.

Furthermore, you have the ability to include metadata for the uploaded media file. Additionally, you can upload webVtt files that will serve as subtitles for the media file.
